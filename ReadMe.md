# 4th Week Assignment

This project is part of the EAG Course's 5th Week Assignment. 
It focuses on applying the concepts learned during the week to solve practical problems and implement solutions effectively.

# Developer's Idea
- Create a presentation which explains the calculation of e^5.342. 
- For every explanation, I want the Agent to draw and Rectangle/Square and then write the text-explanation within the Box.
- The agent needs to get explanation from LLM and then work with MS-Paint for drawing and writing the text.

## Objectives
- This project implements an automated drawing and text manipulation system for Microsoft Paint using Python. Here's a detailed overview:

## Core Components
### MCP (Model-Control-Protocol) Server
- Handles communication between the AI model and Paint application
- Implements various mathematical and utility functions
- Manages tool execution and error handling

### Paint Automation Tools
- draw_rectangle: Creates rectangles with specified coordinates
- add_text_in_paint: Adds text at specified locations
- open_paint: Launches Paint application and maximizes it

### Mathematical Functions
- Basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Advanced math (power, sqrt, cbrt, factorial)
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Special functions (fibonacci, exponential sum)
